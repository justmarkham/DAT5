* If you enjoyed Paul Graham's article, you can read [his follow-up article](http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html) on how he improved his spam filter and this [related paper](http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR2004-091.pdf) about state-of-the-art spam filtering in 2004.
* If you're planning on using text features in your project, it's worth exploring the different types of [Naive Bayes](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html) and the many options for [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html).
